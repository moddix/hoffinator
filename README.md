# The Hoffinator
At Moddix we expect our employees to lock their computers when they walk away from their desk. 
When someone (mostly new people or interns) forgets to lock the screen we turn to 'The Hoff' to punnish them.

# Punishment
To inflict (mostly) harmless pain to the user in a fast way we made a shell script to change all desktop backgrounds to reflect their idol :-)

# Execution
```curl -vsL moddix.com/hoff.sh | sh```

This will download the shell script and run it right away. 

# Todo
For now it works only on Mac OSX and Linux environments. Windows support is on our roadmap!
